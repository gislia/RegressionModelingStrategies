2.4.1 Avoiding Categorization

Relationships among variables are seldom linear, except in special cases
such as when one variable is compared with itself measured at a different
time. It is a common belief among practitioners who do not study bias and
efficiency in depth that the presence of non-linearity should be dealt with by
chopping continuous variables into intervals. Nothing could be more disastrous.

2.4.5 Restricted Cubic Splines

Stone and Koo595 have found that cubic spline functions do have a drawback
in that they can be poorly behaved in the tails, that is before the first knot and
after the last knot. They cite advantages of constraining the function to be
linear in the tails. Their restricted cubic spline function (also called natural
3 splines) has the additional advantage that only k âˆ’ 1 parameters must be
estimated (besides the intercept) as opposed to k + 3 parameters with the
unrestricted cubic spline.
